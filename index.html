                    <p>As more and more churches become apostate and fall away from Scripture, God's children need a new way to fellowship. 
                        Desert Signal is starting a new community of people who have chosen to walk away from the  "church system" to more clearly listen to and learn from God! Come join us!</p><br>

        <h3>The church problem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most churches are corrupt as they no longer present God in full scriptural truth.</li>
            <li>God never called for a church of thousands of denominations with different doctrines and theologies. He is not the author of confusion.</li>
            <li>Seminaries are not places for God's authentic children. God is not understood through college degrees, quizzes, tests, or thesis papers.</li>
            <li>The church offers you a view of God through their "lens". At best, that lens is partially covered, cloudy, and dirty. Remove that lens and you can more clearly see God.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h3>How we conduct ourselves</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We look to the Bible as our sole authority. We are not under the authority of pastors, priests, or evangelists.</li>
            <li>We do not accept money or donations. It is forbidden to make money off of God's word</li>
            <li>We have no "Professional Christians"</li>
            <li>We fellowhsip and wait on God and only move when His Spirit clearly instucts us to do so</li>
        </ul>
